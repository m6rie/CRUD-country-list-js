This is an app which purpose is to make a list of country. The main reason is for travel purposes but it is also the user's choice. 
It gives the user useful informations about the countries selected and allows them to create a list of the countries they have choosen.

What I learned:
- the CRUD operations with Javascript
- how to set up an API (Rest-countries API) with Javascript and retrieve the data
- how to make text slide across a page
